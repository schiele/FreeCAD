  By not providing "FindBoost.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Boost", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Boost" (requested
  version 1.74) with any of the following names:

    BoostConfig.cmake
    boost-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Boost" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Boost_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Boost"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
