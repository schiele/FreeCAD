  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "PCL" with any of
  the following names:

    PCLConfig.cmake
    pcl-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "PCL" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "PCL_DIR"

  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
